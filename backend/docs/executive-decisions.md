# Executive Decisions
For quick decisions in specific game mechanics and other details.

## Executive Decision Rules:
- You may not change these rules unless both of us agree to do so
- Only the creator of the executive decision may change it, unless it is reasonable to do so (e.g. spelling mistake, expansion/clarification)
- You may not have more than 1 executive decision than the other (e.g. if I have 5, you cannot have more than 6)
- You may not use executive decisions to affect a subject that a preexisting executive decision has ruled upon
- You must record every executive decision you have made, and you may not remove executive decisions arbitrarily
- Explicit consent by the other may modify executive decisions or these rules

### HydrogenMacro:
