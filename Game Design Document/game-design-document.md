# Spellfire Game Design Document
Spellfire is a 2D top-down MMORPG with a heavy emphasis on combat where players can fight monsters and bosses in an open world environment. Players can choose between wielding guns, or mastering the art of magic, fighting with spells and abilities. Players can upgrade an expansive skill tree and progress through a deep crafting progression and unlock and equip abilities tailored to custom builds.

## Target Audience
Little kids that play .io games
Sweaty gamers that enjoy shooter games that require mechanical skill and tactics at the highest levels of gameplay (ish)

## Platform
Discord Activities (for now, will expand to discord mobile, website in the future)

## Gameplay
The core gameplay loop revolves around leveling up your character and making it stronger in order to fight stronger players and sentries (hostile mobs). Fight alone or in squads and work together to conquer this world. You can level up your character by gaining exp from kills, and collect rare materials to craft new weapons or learn new abilities/spells.

## Players
Players are divided into two classes, Gunslingers who use guns and Mages who use spells. Players also have an exp system (undetermined how this works rn) and stats that can be leveled up with points based on your level (undetermined as well).

Players will have base stats that can be upgraded (implemented later on):
- 250 hp
- 6 meters/sec movement speed

### Gunslingers
Gunslingers use guns. Guns can be bought (shop at spawn? Main menu shop?) or crafted from materials from sentries/bosses. Guns will primarily shoot hitscan bullets, with a few exceptions (such as heat seeking missiles and RPG rockets, etc). Guns have their own weight classes and handling requirements (your “handling” stat needs to be high enough to use certain guns). Each gun also has a set magazine size, but players will have infinite ammo on most guns, with only a small amount of guns requiring special ammo to be crafted (RPG rockets for example). Swapping guns, how many guns players can have in their inventory, secondaries, all need to be considered but I’m too lazy to consider them rn so [insert future considerations here]. Headshots deal extra damage (hitting closer to the center of the player). Automatic guns have recoil. Spread will increase when the player is shooting while moving.

### Mages
mages [expand on this]
- mana shield to make mages vs guns more balanced

### Building
[out of scope? fortnite?]

## Sentries
literally arras.io tanks [expand on this]

## Environment
[needs improvement]
The world is procedurally generated with world wrapping, and it is split into different biomes:
Plains (the grass makes this area naturally impossible for gamers) 
Boss - Earth Golem, Hephaestus (spawn area maybe)
bruh
Forest (the trees are alive)
Boss - Polar Bear, Artemis 
Desert ( you slowly dehydrate so this is also unplayable)
Dehydra (this name is actually peak bro)
Tundra (its literally that area in genshin) ( u slowly freeze to death so it’s unplayable and people will never get the rpg) dragonspine frfrfrfr
Boss - Yeti

Lake (you instantly drown)
contains Atlantis
neptune has more aura than poseidon
Obtain scuba diving gear from the polar bear to enter (otherwise you instadie, lose all your stats and items, and are permanently banned from the game without any warnings) seems fair
Boss - The Mermaids, Loch Ness, Neptune
Enchanted Forest (you get lost in the forest and can’t escape bcs wrapped map) way too playable
Boss - Queen Pixie, King Pixie, both at once
Volcano (you get sunburn and get cancer and die after 10 minutes so it’s also unplayable) this is too many bosses bruh
Boss - Mechanical Dragon, Reaper, Ares (procedurally animated)
